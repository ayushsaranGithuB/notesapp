There are some great Free Resources for Generating Realistic Data to use for API testing and to populate static designs. 

# Faker
Faker is a Python library that helps you generate fake data. 

Furthermore, it has its own pytest plugin, which provides a faker fixture you can use in your tests.

# Mockaroo

Mockaroo enables you to rapidly and randomly generate test data based on the specifications you define (such as SQL, XML, JSON, and CSV) and load it right into your test environment.
You can also construct and save schemas for later use.

*BONUS* Using the Mockaroo docker image, you can create and deploy a mock APIs to test with.
